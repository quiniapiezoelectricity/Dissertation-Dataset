State Councilor Wang Yi said that China and the US share more common interests than differences. Contradictions and disputes shall not define the current China-US ties. What is more important is that prejudice and misjudgment shall not dictate the future China-US ties. Only with an open mind and inclusive attitude to view things in a momentum of development can bilateral relations break more grounds for development. State Councilor Wang Yi stressed that the right choice must be made when it comes to matters of strategic mutual trust. China is committed to the path of peaceful development. China will not become the US and China has no intention of replacing the US. There will be competition between the two sides, but such competition needs to be positive and conforms with rules. The two sides should be committed to door-opening instead of barrier-erecting, follow the new concept of mutual benefit and win-win results, and discard the outdated mentality of zero-sum game.

"In what way? The US leaders also give interviews of
this or that kind every day, don�t they?",0

the China-US bilateral trade is by no means the so-called ��one-way street� where wealth only goes from the US to China.,0
"As estimated by the USChina
Business Council, US trade with China has helped

The Tariff Policy Commission of the State Council will not exclude the possibility of imposing tariffs on American agricultural products that are purchased after August 3. The relevant Chinese companies have stopped buying those products.
