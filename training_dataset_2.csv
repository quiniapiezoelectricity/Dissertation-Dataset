"Statistics from the US show that Chinese students, accounting for one third of all foreign students in the US, contribute over $15 billion to the country every year.",1.0

"As diplomats, our posts often change.",1.0
I think you'll soon know what his new duty is.,1.0
Hua Chunying: China's position on the visit by the President of the Czech Senate is very clear.,1.0
Vice Foreign Minister Qin Gang summoned the Czech Republic Ambassador to China and lodged stern representations over Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil's visit to Taiwan.,0.0
"Tempted by the Taiwan authority, instigated by anti-China forces and driven by selfish gains, Vystrcil insists on visiting the Taiwan region regardless of China's firm opposition and solemn representations.",0.0
"This is open support for ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces and their activities and has severely infringed upon China's sovereignty and flagrantly interfered in China's domestic affairs.",0.0
China strongly condemns the move.,0.0
"There is only one China in the world, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China, which is recognized by the international community.",1.0
The one-China principle is the Czech Republic's foreign policy and the political basis for China-Czech ties.,1.0
"Vystrcil, as one of the country's leaders, has openly broken international consensus and breached the one-China principle which the Czech government has promised to uphold, severely violating international law and basic norms of international relations.",0.0
China shall take necessary actions to safeguard its legitimate interests.,1.0
"We urge those who openly challenge China's sovereignty out of selfish interest to heed China's solemn position and grave concerns, and not to underestimate the firm resolve of the 1.4 billion Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and security.",0.0
We also call on the Czech people to jointly prevent further harm to China-Czech relations caused by Vystrcil's malicious and shortsighted behavior.,0.0
Hua Chunying: There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.,1.0
The one-China principle is the political foundation and fundamental premise for the establishment and development of diplomatic relations between China and the US.,1.0
"The so-called Taiwan Relations Act unilaterally promulgated by the US and its so-called Six Assurances to Taiwan severely violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqu�s, seriously breach the basic norms governing international relations and grossly interfere in China's internal affairs.",0.0
"They are completely wrong, illegal, null and void, and the Chinese government is firmly opposed to them right from the start.",0.0
"The US should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqu�s, rather than the Taiwan Relations Act or the Six Assurances.",1.0
"I want to stress that the Taiwan question bears on China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and China's core interests.",1.0
No one should underestimate China's firm determination to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.,0.0
"We urge the US side to abide by the one-China principle and the three joint communiqu�s between China and the US, make no attempts to change the nature of its relationship with Taiwan, stop conducting any official exchange with Taiwan, and refrain from moving further down the wrong and dangerous path.",0.0
"Hua Chunying: Like I said, I'm not aware of the specifics related to Cheng Lei and I refer you to the competent authorities.",1.0
China values our relations with Australia.,2.0
"That said, the development of bilateral relations requires efforts made by both sides.",1.0
I'd like to stress one more thing.,1.0
China always upholds the rule of law.,1.0
"Unlike some other countries, we don't practice unlawful deeds in the name of the law.",0.0
Hua Chunying: China has noted the relevant statement issued by the World Bank.,1.0
"We urge the World Bank to conduct internal investigations in accordance with the principles of fairness, objectivity and transparency and the rules and procedures of multilateral institutions, so as to earnestly safeguard the reputation of the World Bank and its member states, as well as the professionalism and credibility of the Doing Business report.",1.0
"The Chinese government attaches great importance to improving its business environment, adheres to world-class standards, and continuously deepens reforms to delegate power, streamline administration and optimize government services so as to stimulate the vitality of market players and the creativity of social sectors.",2.0
"Last year, China has seen on average a net increase of 10,000 Chinese companies per day, and annual foreign direct investment registered a 2.4 percent year-on-year increase to US $138.1 billion.",1.0
These real achievements are recognized and applauded by the international community.,2.0
China will remain committed to deepening reform and creating a market-oriented and law-based business environment that meets international standards so as to create a favorable environment for high-quality economic development.,2.0
"Hua Chunying: On the boundary issue that is left over from history, China always believes that a fair and reasonable agreement can be reached by the two sides through peaceful and friendly consultations.",2.0
"For some time, the two sides have been in touch and in talks at various levels and making efforts to seek peaceful settlement to the boundary issue and jointly safeguard peace and stability of the border areas.",1.0
"But on August 31, in violation of the consensus reached by China and India through talks and meetings at various levels, the Indian troops again illegally crossed the LAC at the southern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake and near the Reqin Mountain, which are in the western sector of the China-India boundary.",0.0
Their flagrant provocations again led to tensions.,0.0
"The Indian side has severely undermined China's territorial sovereignty, breached bilateral agreements and important consensus, and damaged peace and tranquility in the border areas, which runs counter to the recent efforts made by both sides for de-escalation of tensions on the ground.",0.0
China firmly opposes such a move and has lodged stern representations with the Indian side.,0.0
"We urge India to immediately stop all provocations, withdraw its troops who illegally crossed the LAC, and refrain from any moves that may escalate tensions or complicate matters.",1.0
"Hua Chunying: What India said may differ from what China said, but there's only one simple truth.",1.0
"Since the founding of the People's Republic of China more than 70 years ago, we have never initiated a war or conflict, and never taken an inch of land that is not ours.",1.0
"In fact, China's border troops have been strictly abiding by the LAC and they've never trespassed.",1.0
"The Indian side should respect facts and take concrete actions with the good will of preserving China-India relations, so as to jointly preserve peace and tranquility of the border areas.",1.0
We've noted that some Indian media have reported extensively on India deploying more troops in the border areas.,1.0
"If proven true, such a move runs counter to the shared wish of the two peoples, which is to live in peace and ensure a sound and steady development of China-India relations.",1.0
We hope that India will take China's concerns seriously and take concrete actions to ensure the peace and tranquility of the border areas and the sound development of China-India relations.,1.0
Hua Chunying: The remarks by David Stilwell are meant to confuse right and wrong.,0.0
The first duty of a diplomat should be to promote mutual understanding and friendly cooperation.,1.0
"Yet regrettably, the US foreign policy today has turned into diplomacy of coercion, sanctions, lying and scapegoating.",0.0
Some senior US diplomats are making their living by attacking and smearing China.,0.0
"They are busy fabricating lies, spreading hatred, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and even blatantly associating with separatists and terrorists for the purpose of suppressing other countries.",0.0
"They disregard international rules, trample on fairness and justice, and too often withdraw from international agreements and organizations.",0.0
The US now becomes the biggest perpetrator undermining the existing international order.,0.0
This is both a misfortune for the US and a threat to the world.,0.0
I also read the report you mentioned.,1.0
Even the American press has felt distressed about and been fed up with the administration's diplomatic performance.,0.0
"A person should at least have some integrity and honor, and a country should at least have some sense of responsibility.",0.0
We hope the US can behave like a major country and shoulder its due responsibilities.,0.0
"If it cannot step up to play a more positive role for world peace and stability, then the least it can do is to restrain itself from making trouble.",0.0
Hua Chunying: This again proves that the US foreign policy becomes nothing but diplomacy of sanctions.,0.0
"It is pathetic that they are busy all day lying, cheating, shifting the blame, smearing China, threatening to impose sanctions, and announcing sanctions against other countries.",0.0
China has made clear our position on multiple occasions on the US unwarranted oppression against Chinese companies.,0.0
The US identifying 11 Chinese companies as owned or controlled by the Chinese military lacks both legal basis and evidence.,0.0
We firmly oppose that.,0.0
"The US has time and again stretched the concept of national security and abused national power to suppress certain Chinese companies, which is in serious violation of market principles and international trade rules, of which the US is a self-claimed champion.",0.0
"I'd like to stress that Chinese companies that do business overseas have been strictly observing laws and regulations of their host countries, including the US.",0.0
They are committed to market principles and the rule of law.,1.0
"With the respect for market rules and norms, Chinese companies are ready to continue conducting win-win cooperation with other countries.",1.0
We hope the US will stop suppressing certain foreign businesses under the pretext of national security.,0.0
I don't think such moves will do any good to the United States itself.,0.0
Hua Chunying: Mr. Pranab Mukherjee was a veteran statesman and leader of India.,1.0
He visited China multiple times and contributed to the development of China-India relations.,2.0
"As we recall, in 2014, he and Chinese leader announced the decision to build a closer developmental partnership.",2.0

We express our deep condolences over the passing of former President Pranab Mukherjee and our sincere sympathies to his loved ones.,2.0
"China has been comprehensively, accurately, faithfully, and strictly implementing all DPRK-related resolutions adopted by the Security Council, and fulfilling our due international obligations.",2
